## Installing and Running

1. Make sure that you have `node` and `npm` installed on your computer.
2. Fork and clone this repo on your computer.
3. `cd` into the root directory.
4. Run `node Taller.js [firstRangeNumber] [lastRangeNumber] [arrayLength] [numberToFindLS] [numberToFindBS]` and extend your console for better visualization.


Example: ` node .\Taller.js 1 1000 10000 100 200 `

### OUTPUT
Bubble sort Algorithm ✰

- Operation took 1.128 secs
- Number of comparisons done:  98649864
- Number of swap done:  24900979

Selection sort Algorithm ✰

- Operation took 0.293 secs
- Number of comparisons done:  50005000
- Number of swap done:  20002

Quick sort Algorithm ✰

- Operation took 0.015 secs
- Number of comparisons done:  101642
- Number of swap done:  19750

Linear search  ✰

The first position of the element  100 is:  985

- Operation took 0 secs

Binary search  ✰

The first position of the element  200 is:  2030

- Operation took 0.001 secs
